# DDD Project in Java

> The project developed the Domain and Use Case layers of a Bounded context of a fictive fintech "Sofka Credits".
This company lends money to its customers to buy products in different stores around the country and allows to make the payments of these credits in different places and receives a lot of payment methods.
In the development of the project, there are three aggregates: **Customer**, **Credit**, and **Payment** each one has two entities with its methods, commands, and events. Also, there is an implementation of **twelve** use cases with its UnitTest.
